## Development

The frontend is based on JSX. Therefore you need to have npm and node to change it

```
cd youtube-to-post
npm install
npm run start
```
### Post-Settings example

With post-settings you can define what part of the description will be taken and how it is placed within the post content. You can also define a page_template if needed.

**Regex**

```
/(.*)Ãœber die Werteherren/misu
```

The contents in the round brackets are saved as regex-groups. The first () will be made available as __GROUP[0]__, the second () will be __GROUP[1]__. Additionally there is the __VIDEO_ID__ field, which contains the id of the video, e.g. to create a link to the original video. 

Those fields can be used in a configurable inline-template, which takes those values and can contain html and gutenberg markup code.

**Inline-Template**

```
    __GROUP[0]__
    <br />
    <iframe width="640" height="430" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__VIDEO_ID__"></iframe>
```
This would result in a blog post beginning with the description saved in __GROUP[0]__. It adds a newline and then an iframe showing the youtube video using the __VIDEO_ID__.


You can also use blocks in the template, e.g. to add a gutenberg table or video element

```
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    __GROUP[0]__
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:embed {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/__VIDEO_ID__","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"embed-handler","responsive":true,"className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} -->
    <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    https://www.youtube.com/embed/__VIDEO_ID__
    </div></figure>
    <!-- /wp:embed -->

```

**Page Template**

In case your theme supports page_templates for posts, you can define one. A page template is a .php file located in the theme directory, which will be used for the post instead of the default/single.php.

```
a-custom-page-template.php
```

## Hooks

There is one hook available namend **yttp_after_post_creation**, which is executed "after" post and attachment creation. 
It contains the success state, the post itself if created, the post_id and the attachment_id if set

Example

```

add_action('yttp_after_post_creation', 'yttp_after_post_creation_func');

    function yttp_after_post_creation_func($result) {
        error_log('hook test');
        error_log(print_r($result, true));
    }

    /*

        result:

            [03-Apr-2023 16:32:42 UTC] hook test
            [03-Apr-2023 16:32:42 UTC] Array
            (
                [success] => 1
                [post] => Array
                    (
                        [post_title] => This is a title
                        [post_content] => This is a content
                        [post_status] => draft
                        [post_author] => 1
                        [post_type] => post
                        [page_template] => single-custom.php
                    )

                [post_id] => 232
                [attachment_id] => 233
            )


    */

```
